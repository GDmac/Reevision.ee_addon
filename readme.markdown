#Reevision

A very simple ExpressionEngine addon that simply increments a counter
every time an entry is saved. Useful for instance for iCalendar where  
SEQUENCE:X denotes the revision. 

The field just outputs how many times the entry was saved. 
You can hide the field from the layout if you want. For safecracker 
set div.reevision to display:none;
